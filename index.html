    <h1>Study Notes</h1>
    My respected professor once said, "If you cannot derive all the theorems or equations to solve a problem in mathematics or physics by yourself, 
    you haven't truly solved it," 
    and I try to keep that as much as possible. 
    However, as I study new things, I often feel that the knowledge I learned in the past gradually fades from my memory. 
    I've decided to start writing what I learned at my own pace and plan to upload it.
